#NEARBAR 

A single page application for users to find the nearest bar with the highest ratings around their current location. This project was created to so that users could easily find a place of quality to unwind and relax.

#UX DESIGN
Design for this project is simple and clear so as to not distract users from the main purpose of the website. The main goal is that any user can quickly find the nearest and highest rated bars based on users current location. The user is able to see ratings, address and contact details of each bar.

#User Stories:
As a User I want to be able to find a decent bar around me quickly .
As a User I want to be able to search for bars around my location so that is it convenient for me.
As a User I dont want to be wasting time sourcing for highly rated bars and then trying to find the bars location.
As a User I want to select a specific bar and get the correct contact details and address for that place, so that I can give a place a call to reserve a table if need be. A picture of the place would be most welcomed.

#TECHNOLOGIES
The Technologies I Have Used:
Google Maps API - I have used the Google Maps API for their google maps service.
Google Places API - I have use the Google Places Api for use of their points of bars to be added to my map.
Bootstrap - I have used Bootstrap for it's grid system, making my application responsive.
Boostrap Font Awesome - I have used the Bootstrap Font Awesome CDN to make use of their social icons.
javascript - All major functionality for this project is dependent on JavaScript.


#TESTING
I conducted tests on a wide selction of browsers/devices to ensure User's can successfully use the site and it's features.

###Tests conducted:
checks were done to ensure functionality of the Google Maps Api, making sure everything worked as it should.
Checks were done to ensure that geolocation was working in various places and users.
Made sure the code runs wihtout issues using the Google Chrome Inspect Tools. Inside Chromes Dev Tools I can:
Check the responsiveness for individual phones and screens, example, an IPhone/Samsung.
Use the console to check the stability of my JavaScript files so that there is no errors and it is not broken.
I can also change and adapt my code inside the Tools, to see what works and what doesn't. Also staying aware that these changes I make are not permenant.
I have used a code Validator for each type of code in my project which can be found Here.
Here is each Validator used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
These tests included browsers/devices:

Edge - laptop
Mozilla - laptop
Chrome - laptop and Android
Safari - laptop 
Internet Explorer - laptop
User Stories Testing
"As a User I want to be able to see the bars ratings so that I have a good understanding on whether or not that place would be worth going to." I have tested this by clicking on individual markers making sure the details are all there and easily viewed.
"As a User I want to be able to pick the best and most conveniently located bar around me. This was tested by making sure the geolocation and nearby places search was working.
"As a User I want to select a specific bar and get the correct contact details and address for that place, so that I can give a place a call to reserve a table if need be." This was tested by again making sure I had used Google's API correctly and it was showing the correct infomation.

#DEPLOYMENT
Throughout the course of this project I have been commiting every finished functionality, every bug fix and things I thought needed removing, to GitHub using Version Control.

I have fully deployed this application to GitHub Pages which can be found Here.
